# Xavier Renegade Angel 3ds To FBX Conversion

These are the 3DS .max animation files originally published for Xavier Renegade Angel Contest. I have tried my best to update them to make them more modern, but conversion has been difficult.

## FBX files

These files were exported from 3ds, but there was issues. 

## Shakashuri

The first was not all textures on Shakashuri was applied properly. I fixed them as to how they were supposed to be, but when exporting to .fbx from blender it does not save changes. I have included the blend file which has how material should be properly applied.

## Xavier

This is the direct .3ds conversion with proper rigging. I was not able to fix the walk animation (will not convert properly). I have positioned the model correctly, remapped original rig and confirmed working through mixamo. I intend to modernize the rig further but right now it's a working rig that can be plugged into most modern animation software. If the textures do not load for you, you can use find missing files option in blender and select the textures folder.

## Textures

If the textures do not apply correctly when opening .blend file you will have to go to file > external data > find missing files and select the texture folder as target.
