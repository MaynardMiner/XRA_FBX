# Xavier Renegade Angel 3ds To FBX Conversion

These are the 3DS .max animation files originally uploaded for Xavier Renegade Angel Contest. I have tried my best to update them to make them more modern, but conversion has been difficult.

## FBX files

These files were exported from 3ds, but there was issues. 

## Shakashuri

The first was not all textures on Shakashuri was applied properly. I fixed them as to how they were supposed to be, but when exporting to .fbx from blender it does not save changes. I have included the blend file which has how material should be properly applied.

## Xavier

This is the direct .3ds conversion with proper rigging. The sample animation is not working I have been unable to restore but the rigging is in tact. I have tried to include a .fbx file with embedded textures but when I attempt to export the model is never positioned correctly.

## Textures

If the textures do not apply correctly when opening .blend file you will have to go to file > external data > find missing files and select the texture folder as target.
